# Unhandled TypeError in JavaScript Function

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error: attempting to access a property (`.length` in this case) of an undefined value.  The `foo` function is designed to handle null values gracefully, but it fails to handle undefined values, resulting in a runtime error.

The solution demonstrates how to improve the function to correctly handle both null and undefined values, preventing the error.
